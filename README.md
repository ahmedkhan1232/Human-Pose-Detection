# Human-Pose-Detection
“Human Pose Detection using Deep Learning enables real-time analysis of body poses for exercise and yoga, offering guidance without physical instructors. Using neural networks and transformer vision models trained on large datasets, the system tackles occlusion, scale, and viewpoint variations for accurate, robust pose detection.”
